# AMAZON PRODUCTS ANALYSIS 
This project aims to investigate Amazon products performance based on various factors such as rating and discount in order to drive insights on improving product performance. 
#INSTALLATION
This project has used pandas,numpy for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation.The database used for the project is MYSQL.
#DATA
The dataset used in this project is the Amazon dataset.It contains 1465rows and 16 columns.The data was cleaned by removing missing values and handling data types.
RESULTS
From the analysis we find that products in the car and motorbike category were the poorest performing products in the data.This was followed closely by the products in the health and personal care category.This was all based on the rating counts of the products.The best performing categories were electronics followed by computer accessories as they had higher rating counts.
From the correlation analysis we can infer a weak positive correlation between rating and rating count.We also find that higher discounts on products improved their rating and rating counts.
From the results we can recommend that the Amazon team should prioritise products that fall in the car and motorbike category and health and personal care category due to low performance in the market.
Poor performing products should have their discount percentage increased as the product rating is seen to increase with higher discount amounts and products that had higher discount had higher rating counts.The Amazon team should also improve rating as it had a weak positive correlation with rating count.From the analysis, products with higher rating are seen to be performing better.
